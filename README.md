Atlas Assets
============

This Ruby gem holds all shared assets used throughout the O'Reilly Atlas platform. 

Style Guide
-----------

For reference, visit the online [style guide documentation](http://atlas-assets.herokuapp.com) included in this gem.

Usage
-----

To use in a new Rails application, add the gem to your Gemfile, and add the following to your CSS (`app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`) and JS (`app/assets/javascripts/application.js`) manifest files.

```javascript
*= require atlas_assets
```

Along with all the CSS and JS widgets, it will include our base bundle of JS libraries (`JQuery`, `underscore.js`, `backbone.js`, etc). It will also set up a number of JS namespaces `window.classes`, `window.app`, `window.events` and `window.constants`, so make sure to include the JS manifest before any of your JS code.

If you need to, you can import individual stylesheets from this gem in your application:

```css
@import "atlas_assets/icons";
```

Local Development
-----------------

To get started on your own machine first install the required gems with bundler"

```
bundle install
```

Then to run the site and watch for changes run:

```
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

This will launch the jekyll command as well as a second script to watch for changes to stylesheets and write those changes to `docs/ignore` to trigger rebuilds from jekyll. That folder is ignored by git and can be safely deleted.

Adding new styles
-----------------

If you need to add or change styles in this gem, first get a local environment set up:

1. Clone down the gem to your local machine
2. Run `bundle` from the gem root
3. Fire up jekyll by running `jekyll serve --watch`

You now have the site running in your browser on `localhost:4000`. Now follow these steps to add and document the new style(s):

1. Create you own feature branch
2. Implement your style by tweaking the CSS and checking the documentation on `localhost:4000`. Do not work from the specific Atlas Rails app by updating the gem constantly. All new styles should be developed using the `docs`, and should be independent from a particular application.
3. When ready, bump the version number in `lib/atlas_assets/version.rb`, run `bundle update` and send a pull request to the master branch.
4. When the pull request has been accepted, we'll publish the gem by running  `gem build atlas_assets.gemspec` and `gem push [NAME].gem`.
5. Bump the `atlas_assets` gem version in your apps `Gemfile`, run `bundle`, and use the new styles.
